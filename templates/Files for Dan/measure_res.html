<p>
The null hypothesis that the means of the {k} populations are equal will be tested by an F test.  </p>
<p>A p-value less than {{anova1.alpha}} will be considered statistically significant.
</p>
<p>
Justification of sample size:
<br>  
The sample size of {{anova1.n_per_arm}} per arm was determined based on these assumptions:  power={{anova1.power}}; significance level of test={{anova1.alpha}}; within-arm standard deviation={{anova1.sigma}} 
<br>and population means under the alternative hypothesis={{anova1.mus}}
</p>
